# Simple Python Web Scraper

This project demonstrates a basic Python web scraper.

## What it does

These steps are for macOS. For other operating systems, the virtual environment setup differs; dependency installation and running the script are the same. Please google how to set up a Python virtual environment (venv) for your OS.

1. Create and activate a virtual environment:
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate

2. Install dependencies:
   pip install -r requirements.txt

3. Run script:
   python scraper.py

4. Deactivate when finished:
   deactivate
